# Subject - The string calculator

The calculator is a function which took a string and a delimiter as parameters and 
return the sum of all numbers in it. You'll need to implement it!

It should ignore non-numbers.

For example: `sumOfNumbers(“1;2;3;coucou;4”, “;”)` should return `10`.


# Used libraries

We use [jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for the unit tests.

# Requirements

Having Docker and Docker-compose installed!

Initialize the Docker environment by executing this: `make build`.

# Usage

You can run unit tests with `make run-unit`.
