# Subject - The string calculator

The calculator is a function which took a string and a delimiter as parameters and 
return the sum of all numbers in it. You'll need to implement it!

It should ignore non-numbers.

For example: `sum_of_numbers(“1;2;3;coucou;4”, “;”)` should return `10`.


# Used libraries

We use [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/) for the unit tests.

# Requirements

Having Docker and Docker-compose installed!
